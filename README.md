## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: 
7, I attempted all of the sections, but ran into an error with node_modules and ./util in the Jest section, and then couldn't figure how to write a test for cypress. I found where it was but I don't understand calling elements and what server should i pass
